# Data Repository for the Non-reporting Entities

If you are an issuer with an existing SEC exempt offering under regulation D, regulation A tier 1 or a non-reporting interstate offering, you can now provide quarterly and annual reporting to your investors and potential investors on a voluntarily basis without the need for an audit.

Resales are subject to reporting requirements

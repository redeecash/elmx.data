# Data Repository for the Non-reporting Entities

If you are an issuer with an existing SEC exempt offering under regulation D, regulation A tier 1 or a non-reporting interstate offering, you can now provide quarterly and annual reporting to your investors and potential investors on a voluntarily basis without the need for an audit.

You will need an SEC issued CIK code and the SEC issued file number for each exempt offering, when applicable.

Submit your annual and quarterly reports from your dashboard at [https://redeecash.exchange](https://redeecash.exchange).

Resales are subject to reporting requirements

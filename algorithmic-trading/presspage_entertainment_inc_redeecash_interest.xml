    <description>THIS EXPERT ADVISOR (EA) IS FOR ACCOUNTS WHICH PAY OVERNIGHT INTEREST LIKE THE US-BASED OANDA ACCOUNT. TO MAXIMIZE EARNINGS, CHOOSE A COMMISSION-FREE, FIX SPREAD ACCOUNT. IF YOUR BROKER DOES NOT PAY OVERNIGHT INTEREST, THEN DO NOT USE THIS EA ON YOUR ACCOUNT!

This Expert Advisor (EA) is like a high-yield savings account (EXCEPT YOUR ACCOUNT IS NOT FDIC-INSURED) because a trade will occur on currency pairs that pay(earn) overnight interest (when SWAPRATE_LONG and SWAPRATE_SHORT are positive). The entry and exit positions are based on the lookback period Lowest/Highest and Highest/Lowest prices for buy and sell orders respectively.</description>
